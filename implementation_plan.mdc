## Implementation Notes

1. Start with the first TODO item in Milestone 1
2. Complete each task in sequence
3. Mark tasks as DONE only after testing
4. Update documentation as you go
5. Commit changes after each completed task

@Cursor: After completing a task, change its status to DONE and add a brief marker "// done by Cursor" with a description of what was done.
